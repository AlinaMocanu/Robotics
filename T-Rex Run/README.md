T-Rex Run!
 The game is a replica of the Chrome Dinosaur Game, where the dinosaur is actually a dot that has to avoid the incoming obstacles in order to reach high score. There are three levels which differ through the difficulty of avoiding the obstacles. By making your way out through the three levels, the purpose is to reach high score. The more obstacles have been avoided, the higher the score will be.
 
 How to play?
  By default, the dot moves further. When reaching an obstacle or a discontinuous stretch of ground, help him jump over them by pressing the pushbutton on the left side of the matrix. Jumping too late or too early will not help him at all, and one of his three lives will be lost.
-Lives: The dot has three lives. Each time a life is lost, a sad face will be displayed and a short warning sound will be played. Still, the game will resume shortly after that and the speed and score won't be altered, so watch out! The number of lives will be updated and displayed on the lcd.
- Game end: The game will actually end under one single condition: there are no lives left, as the main purpose is reaching greater high score each time. Once the game ends, the sad face will be displayed again and a sound will announce the end of the game. Keep an eye on the lcd, as the final details of the game will be displayed and also, you will find out if you made it to high score. From here, you have two options: either play again, or go to the main menu. 
- Levels: As the speed increases, at some point, the level will be incremented. If the speed will suddenly decrease, this means the level has been incremented. You can check this by looking on the lcd. By default, the game starts at level 1, but you can choose a different starting level. See how you can do that in the "Settings" section.
  Level 1:  the obstacles are easy to overcome, as they are quite small.
  Level 2:  this is where it gets tricky. The obstacles are now wider, so jumping too early will cost you a life. Moreover, there are               obstacles that you can only avoid by not jumping.
  Level 3 : this last level is your chance to get a higher score. Now you may encounter two obstacles dangerously close to each other,               so  make sure to jump a bit earlier so you can land between the two obstacles and then jump right back up. The gap between               two stretches of ground is also wider, so don't rush it: jump when you've reached the edge.
  
  -In the "Settings" option, you can enter your name in the serial. Make sure you don't ignore this feature, as you wouldn't want to reach high score as "unknown"!
  if the first level seems like a piece of cake, you can skip it. Just choose a starting level using the horizontal axis of the joystick.
  - In "Info" section you can find details about the game: creater, name of the game and link to the source code on github. Use the horizontal axis of the joystick to see all info.
  -Check the "Highscore" section to see the best score and who owns it. 
  
  
  NOTE! Browsing through the menu is done exclusively with the joystick. Use the Oy axis to browse through items of the menu/submenus and the press button to enter/exit a submenu.
