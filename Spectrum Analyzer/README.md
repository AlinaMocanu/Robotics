Spectrum Analyzer that analyzes the intensity of different frequencies in a song. The obtained values will be displayed on a 10x10 LED Matrix. 

Hardware components:

    - 10  ws2812B LED strips
    
    - wires
    
    - Arduino Uno
    
    - 2x100k resistors
    
    - 3x5k resistors
    
    - audio jack module
    
    - jack to jack cable
    
    - 2x104nF capacitor

   The second tutorial offers a thorough explanation of how a spectrum analyzer works, exemplifying on 4 8x8 led matrixes. From there on, i had to understand it so i can use it for my 10x10 matrix of LED strips.
